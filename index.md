# Architectural Constraints for Autonomous Agents in Financial Systems

**A Design Constraints Framework for Financial AI Systems**

*Work in progress — November 2025*

---

## What This Is

A practitioner's framework for thinking about how AI agents should be architected when they interact with financial systems. The framework helps **right-size architecture** based on three scaling dimensions:

- **Autonomy level** — Is the agent advising humans or executing actions?
- **Action irreversibility** — Can mistakes be undone, or are they permanent?
- **Regulatory surface area** — What audit, explainability, and compliance requirements apply?
